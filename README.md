# samba-db

Python module to read and write samba tdb files.


# Intention:

There is already a samba module which is able to read and write entryes from the tdb,
but its only available as compiled code or as `.deb` files.

So this was not OS independent and not able to use in virtualenvs without inherting the
system environment.
